              My goal as a teacher is to develop a total child. I believe that fostering on students' mental health, 
              academic development, cognitive development, social-emotional development, physical health and identity 
              development will help them to meet the demand of the 21s Century. I teach using interactive based learning 
              activities. These learning activities enable students to collaborate, think critically, analyse, solve 
              problems, and be innovative as well as creative. They become change makers who are able to bring positive 
              changes in their communities rather than passive consumers who just passively observe what is going on in 
              the society. The use of technology must be embraced and integrated in my classroom. I cherish and encourage 
              freedom of expression in my classroom.

        <h3>Contributions To Students' Development</h3>
        <p>
          I am a multi-talented teacher and a high achiever. I do make my physical and virtual classrooms more
          innovative and creative.
          This I extend to other subjects in sclence and mathematics department. For example, I created instructional
          games to teach
          water cycle, Nitrogen cycle in Biology and Atomic structure in Chemistry to enhance deep understanding of
          these concepts among
          the students. I created instructional material to teach Trigonometric ratio in Mathematics by using fingers.
          Some instructional materials in Physics were modeled by my students to let them have deep understanding of the
          concept taught.
          These creative instructional materials were presented at 2021 Lagos State Festhwal of Instructional Material;
          the project won
          2nd position in Lagos State, Project category. <br>

          In addition, my creative and innovative skills enable me to create a craftwork for 2021 Lagos State Tree
          Planting Day.
          My project came 1st in Lagos State and Botanical Garden was donated to the school by Lagos State Parks and
          Garden Agency
          (LASPARK) and Nigeria Conservation Foundation. When I was at Ojota Senior Secondary School, my projects,
          pot-in-pot refrigerator
          and ethanol stove won the best project award during 2014 climate change. My student was sponsored to Germany
          by Lagos
          State Govemment. Even as a Physics teacher, I groomed students for all the competitions in the school such as
          drama, debate,
          Spelling-Bee and science competitions. I am responsible for coordinating co-curricular activities within the
          school. Many awards
          were won for the school at both State and National levels. Through my unrelented efforts some of my students
          have secured
          scholarships to study at university. Also, my student was sponsored to Finland by Lagos State Government for
          being the second
          runner-up in 2014 Final Lagos State Spelling Bee competition when I was at Ojota Senior Secondary School. <br>

          Furthermore, my students have been consistently recording 100% performance in Physics at both WAEC and NECO.
          They were able to
          develop critical thinking, collaboration, digital, creativity and problem solving skills as a result of the
          inquiry-based learning
          activities use in my classroom. This helped and enabled them to compete with undergraduates from universities
          in Designathon 2020 4
          Youth By Youth contest. Out of 264 research proposals that were submitted for the competition throughout
          Nigeria, the research
          proposal from my students (Edoro Team) was among 13 entries that were selected for final contest at
          Designathon 2020. My students
          (Edoro Team) from Kosofe Senior College came up with 3rd position in Nigeria at the final contest. University
          of Ibadan came up with
          1st position and University of llorin was the 1 runner-up. They were given cash prizes. <br>

          Also, the good relationship I have with my sutdents enabled me to detect an indigent student who was kidnapped
          from Benin
          Republic when he was 9 years old. He could not remember anything about his family again. Since then, he has
          been sleeping in
          front of shops at New Garage, Ojota. He worked at Owode after school hours to take care of himself. I
          presented his
          case to an NGO known as Human Physics Department at Obafemi Awolowo University Ile-lfe. The parents will not
          know that their
          child is still alive, but l believe God can still connect him with his family one day. Above all, a student
          was withdrawn from
          Lagos State Model College, lgbobo in 2004 because he repeated twice and was brought to Kosofe Senior College
          under my
          supervision as his class teacher, through proper monitoring and counseling, the boy had the best WASSCE result
          in Kosofe Zone,
          Lagos as a Medical Doctor, now in abroad. I am multi-tasking, that is, I can work on several activities at the
          same time with
          or without supervision such that none will suffer. I have not become Vice-Principal but because we have only
          one Vice-Principal
          in the school, I perform some roles of vice principal in the school.

        <p>
          Asides my teaching job and contributions to students' development, mycontributions to community development
          are as follows: <br>

          (SDGs) and
          Education for Sustainable Development in schools and community. I am also one of the award leaders in Lagos

          me in guiding andsupporting young people in developing their skills (sponsored by theInternational Award for

          Nigeria). <br>

          schools under

                  feels this way.

                  From the very beginning, it was clear that Mrs. Abidoye Aderonke was not just a Teacher, but a mentor, a

                  guide, and a friend. She took the time to get to know each of us as individuals, to understand our
                  
                  unique strengths and weaknesses, and to create a learning environment that was both challenging and supportive.

                  Mrs. Abidoye Aderonke has an incredible ability to make even the most challenging topic accessible and
                 
                  engaging. She has a gift for breaking down complex concepts into manageable pieces, and for finding creative ways to
                 
                  help us understand and retain the information. But what truly sets Mrs. Abidoye Aderonke apart is her unwavering dedication to her students. She goes
                 
                  above and beyond to ensure that we are not only learning but thriving. She is always available to answer questions,
                 
                  offer guidance, or just lend an ear when we need someone to talk to. <br>

                  Thanks to Mrs. Abidoye Aderonke's guidance and support, I have grown not only as a student but as a
                 
                  person. She has challenged me to think critically, push myself beyond my comfort zone, and never settle for less than
                
                  my best. She has inspired me to pursue my passions and to believe in myself even when things get tough.

                  I know that I speak on behalf of all of us (Her Students) when I say that we are truly grateful for everything that Mrs. Abidoye

                  Aderonke has done for us. She is more than just a teacher - she is a role model, a source of
                  
                  inspiration, a true friend, and a teacher. <br>

                  Thank you, Mrs. Abidoye Aderonke, for being the best teacher we have ever had. Your influence will
                  
                  stay with us for a lifetime, and we are all better off for having had the privilege of learning from you.
